# Privacy Policy

## Media Downloader - Privacy First Commitment

This application is built with privacy as a core principle. Here's what that means:

### 🔒 What We DON'T Do

- **No Tracking**: We don't track your usage, downloads, or browsing habits
- **No Analytics**: No third-party analytics services (Google Analytics, etc.)
- **No Data Collection**: We don't collect, store, or transmit any personal data
- **No External Requests**: Download requests go directly to content providers, not through our servers
- **No Cookies**: No tracking cookies or local storage beyond basic functionality

### ✅ What We DO

- **Local Processing**: All downloads happen on your device/server
- **Direct Connections**: Downloads connect directly to content platforms
- **Open Source**: Full transparency - you can review all the code
- **No Logging**: No persistent logs of your downloads or URLs
- **Local Storage Only**: Downloads are saved only to your local `downloads/` folder

### 🌐 Network Activity

The only network requests made are:
1. **Content Platforms**: Direct requests to YouTube, Instagram, TikTok, etc. for video data
2. **No Intermediaries**: No requests go through our servers or third-party services

### 📁 Data Storage

- **Downloads**: Saved locally in the `downloads/` folder
- **No Database**: We don't maintain any database of your activity
- **No Cloud Sync**: Everything stays on your device

### 🔐 Security

- All processing happens locally
- No authentication required (local use only)
- HTTPS recommended for production deployments

### 🤝 Your Rights

You have complete control:
- Delete downloads at any time
- Review all source code
- Run offline (after initial setup)
- No accounts or registration required

### 📝 Changes to This Policy

Since this is a local application, you control any updates. Privacy principles remain core to the project.

### ❓ Questions?

Since this is a self-hosted application, all code is available for review. If you have privacy concerns, please review the source code or contribute improvements.
